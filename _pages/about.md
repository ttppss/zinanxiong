<div class="about-section">
  <p class="about-text">Dr. X is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the P Laboratory, where he conducts cutting-edge research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medical imaging. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of M(USA) in February 2025, following his M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from N University (USA) in January 2016, and his B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from Beijing University in June 2013.</p>

  <p class="about-text">His research primarily focuses on AI-driven medical computer vision, with specialized expertise in Multimodal Large Language Models, deep learning-based lesion detection, and generative AI for healthcare applications. During his doctoral studies, he established long-term collaborations with leading medical institutions in China, including Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and Xiangya Hospital, working closely with clinicians to develop AI-assisted diagnostic systems for: gastrointestinal polyp recognition, detection, and segmentation (endoscopic imaging), gastritis classification (histopathology and endoscopic analysis), breast and thyroid ultrasound lesion identification (multi-modal imaging), and rare disease image data augmentation using diffusion models. His research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., ISBI, ICME).</p>

  <p class="about-text">Beyond his technical contributions, Dr. X actively participates in the AI in Medicine research community, serving as a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Plos One, IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.</p>
