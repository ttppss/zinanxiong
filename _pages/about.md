Dr. Xiong​ is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Peng Cheng National Laboratory, where he conducts cutting-edge research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medical imaging. He received his Ph.D. in ​Computer Science​ from the ​University of Massachusetts Lowell (USA)​​ in February 2025, following his ​M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering​ from ​Northeastern University (USA)​ in January 2016, and his ​B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering​ from ​Beijing University of Chemical Technology in June 2013.

His research primarily focuses on ​AI-driven medical computer vision, with specialized expertise in ​Multimodal Large Language Models, deep learning-based lesion detection, and generative AI for healthcare applications. During his doctoral studies, he established ​long-term collaborations​ with leading medical institutions in China, including ​Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH)​​ and ​Xiangya Hospital, working closely with clinicians to develop ​AI-assisted diagnostic systems​ for: gastrointestinal polyp recognition, detection, and segmentation​ (endoscopic imaging), ​gastritis classification​ (histopathology and endoscopic analysis), breast and thyroid ultrasound lesion identification​ (multi-modal imaging), and rare disease image data augmentation​ using diffusion models. His research has been published in ​top-tier conferences and journals​ (e.g., ISBI, ICME).

Beyond his technical contributions, Dr. Xiong actively participates in the ​AI in Medicine​ research community, serving as a ​reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Plos One, IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics​​.
