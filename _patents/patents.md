title: "Digestive endoscopy oropharynx passing time automatic detection system and method"
authors: ["Yu Cao", "Zinan Xiong", "Qilei Chen", "Benyuan Liu"]
description: "The present invention discloses an automatic detection system and method for measuring oropharyngeal passage time during digestive endoscopy. The automatic detection system comprises an image dynamic preprocessing module, a convolutional neural network-based scene classifier, a bidirectional scene transition module, an exception handling module, and an oropharyngeal passage time calculation module. The provided automatic detection system and method can accurately provide scene information for CAD systems in digestive endoscopy, precisely determine the duration from when the endoscope exits the oral cavity to when it descends into the esophagus, and output the oropharyngeal passage time, thereby facilitating accurate assessment of digestive endoscopy operators' proficiency levels."
